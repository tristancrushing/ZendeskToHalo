      - Special Attention Variables `snake_case`
- **Commenting:**
    - Provide clear comments for complex logic.
    - Use PHPDoc comments for classes and methods.
- **File Structure:**
    - Keep related functions and classes in the same file or folder.
    - Name files and folders descriptively.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork and Clone:** Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your feature or fix. Name the branch something descriptive.

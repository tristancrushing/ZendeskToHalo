### Purpose of the Zendesk to Halo Library

The Zendesk to Halo library was developed to address a real-world problem faced by Managed Service Providers (MSPs) involving the consolidation of multiple legacy ticketing systems into a single platform. This library specifically targets the integration of Zendesk export data into the Halo system.

### Educational Use and PHP Learning

This library is also intended for educational purposes, particularly for use in computer science courses. It serves as a practical example of PHP programming and Composer library development, offering insights into real-world coding challenges, best practices in PHP, and the nuances of working with data transformation and integration.
